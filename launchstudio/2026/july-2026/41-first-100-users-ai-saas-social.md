🔥 Connor built a prototype using **Cursor** — connor, a startup founder, used **cursor** to build a ai invoice extractor prototype, but discovered critical architecture, security, and deployment bottlenecks before going live. 🧠

If your AI prototype lacks server-side input sanitization, database Row Level Security (RLS), or proper deployment configuration, real user traffic will trigger severe crashes and security risks.

❌ Hardcoded API credentials exposed in client-side JavaScript or un-encrypted `.env` files
❌ Missing Row Level Security (RLS) policies on vector and relational database tables
❌ Unhandled API errors, race conditions, or unmetered billing loops under live concurrent load

✅ Moving secret keys to server-side Edge Function vaults with JWT authentication middleware
✅ Enforcing PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS) policies for complete multi-tenant data isolation
✅ Hardening payment webhooks, rate limiting, and deployment infrastructure for high uptime

At **LaunchStudio**, we've been fixing exactly this class of production engineering problem since 2014 through Manifera, across 160+ delivered projects. 🛡️

Connor's application achieved production readiness: Connor onboarded 100+ European businesses without a single billing configuration error. (€1,600 (SaaS Tax Integration Package) — production-ready and deployed in 5 business days.). 🚀
